## Sprint 3 report

## Assigned Roles 

###### IT Operations - Alex Wang <jwang206@hawk.iit.edu>
The main task for IT Operations was to ensure all of our laptops could deploy for the midterm presentation. He had to make sure there is no manual intervention and fuly automated using scripting and customization within Packer and post install scripts. This was our top priority as in previous sprints we didnt fully automate the deployment so some work was required to meet the midterm deliverable.  

###### Project Manager - Khang Duong <kduong1@hawk.iit.edu>
The project manager set realistic goals for the midterm that meet the midterm deliverables and assigned the tasks to each member. Also made some engineering decisions to shift our focus towards automation and deployment as the midterm requirement is for all members to be deployed. The project manager also worked on the midterm report to report the overall progress from all Sprints and present it in front of the class. 


###### UI/UX - Aury Bwashi <abwashi@hawk.iit.edu>
The UI/UX worked closely with the developer to make sure the Login and Registration page are fully functional and have an user friendly interface. 

###### Developer - David Powers <dpowers@hawk.iit.edu>
The developer was working to fix the CORS issue that we had from previous sprint and also incorporating bcrypt.js node module to hash the user passwords and store them safely. These two tasks lie under "Login and Registration Function" card. Also we ran into some GitHub issues that needed to revert back to some commits. Some of us were new to using github so this was part of our learning process.

This Sprint we ran into few problems and had to prioritize our goals again so we can meet the midterm requirements. We were lacking on the Operation so we shifted our focus towards the automation. We discussed as a team to set goals for the midterm which was to make sure Login and Sign Up is fully functional and integrated with MongoDB. Our UI/UX role had to refine the login and sign up form layout of the webpages, and create Dashboard page for our Video Call window for both Authenticated and Unathenticated users. Our project manager was keeping track of everyone's work and make sure everyone was on top of their task. Also, the project manager had to prepare the written report and a oral presentation. The IT Operations had to make sure everyone's environment can deploy without manual intervention.
