#### Project Name and Concept
Our project is called InterpretAir and it is going to be a web application that uses real-time video translation.
The goal is to improve the communication quality between people who donâ€™t speak the same language by utilizing existing technologies (i.e. Amazon Transcribe, Google Translate, Vidyo) in the form of API's and building our own product.

#### Scope
This project will be a web-based Real Time Communication platform used to transcribe and translate communication remotely between users.
Possible features include translation between numerous languages, chat room integration, storage of chat data, data encryption, user authentication, and features for assistive hearing. The project duration is 16 weeks starting from January 9th until April 22nd.

# 13 Base Project Requirements
### 1. JavaSript - NodeJS/Angular/React
### 2. Operating System: Ubuntu Linux Distribution
### 3. MongoDB used to store data.
### 4. Data encrypted at rest
Passwords are hashed to protect personal information. Private networks are only being used by admin.
### 5. Database Master/Slave Replication
### 6. Use of Responsive Design 
Make sure login and signup are resizable and work cross platforms both on the website and mobile phones. 
### 7. Use of https
Make sure the communication is secured and protected. Real Time Communication. 
#### a. Self-signed certs 
#### b. Google Authentication for login
Using Gmail to login. 
#### c. SQRL
### 8. Use of user authentication
Unathenticated users can use the platform without logging in, by just creating a room and inviting other users in. Transcripts are not stored in their account but end of each call, there will be a summary page with the option to download or email the transcript to themselves. 

Authenticated users will have their own account where they can store their transcripts and have a list of contacts. The list of contacts allows the user to chat or call them when they are online. 

### 9. Creation of Dev Environment (local laptop)
Most of our configurations are done by scripts under provisioners in our VagrantFile.  

### 10. Layout Design
Layout design is simple and user friendly. Not cluttered, it will be minimal but still with all the required functionalityies. 

### 11. Management of Visio
Created diagrams of User workflow and Application architecture
Application Architecture of MEAN stack and MVC infrastructure. 

### 12. Management of Project progress
1. Trello
These cards help us stay on top of our tasks and see what everyone is doing. The cards hold us accountable and responsible for different tasks. If someone runs into a problem, they can ask for help or assistance on slack or in weekly meetings. 

2. Slack
Slack is used extensively to communicate and chat about our progress and problems. Share technologies that could be implemented in our project and see what is feasible. 

3. Github
This is where our entire code is hosted on. We can see who 

4. Github Issues to resolve bug posts from UI/UX tester

### 13. 15 real "test" users and proper data to test functionality of a system - No system is ever used "blank" always fill it up with real data
Users accounts are stored in the database server after the user inputs their personal information in the registration form. There are 15 test users that can login to the authenticated site which allows them use the main functionalities and store transcripts after phone call.
