#### Project Name and Concept
Our project is called InterpretAir and it is going to be a web application that uses real-time video translation.
The goal is to improve the communication quality between people who donâ€™t speak the same language by utilizing existing technologies (i.e. Amazon Transcribe, Google Translate, Vidyo) in the form of API's and building our own product.

#### Scope
This project is a web-based Real Time Communication platform used to transcribe and translate communication remotely between users who don't speak the same language. The project duration is 16 weeks starting from January 9th until April 22nd. Features that will be implemented in this time frame will be video call between two or more users (video conference/group call up to 6 users). Transcribing the video call conversations and translating the transcripts to the desired language by the user - this feature will only be implemented between two users due to the time constraint. The transcripts will be saved if the user is signed up and has an account with InterpretAir. All personal information and password will be protected using database encryption and password hashing.

### Industry Competitors
#### Skype/Skype Translate
##### How do they function:
Skype is a proprietary VoIP system using its own protocol based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking; essentially, it works by creating ad-hoc, direct communication between two computers on the Internet. When you sign on to Skype, your computer becomes one node in a global network of equal peers. Each Skype user runs a piece of software called a client that allows them to send messages to other Skype users, make calls, send files, and play real-time games. Each of the clients becomes an active part of the network and, whether it's actively sending messages or not, helps the network as a whole to locate and route traffic to other users. Within the network, some of the users with highest bandwidth and best connectivity, known as supernodes, act as traffic hubs. The network as a whole is made up of supernodes connected to one another, with each supernode linking to many ordinary nodes.

Skype Translate takes the words you speak, converts them into text, translates that text, and then synthesizes them into spoken words in the language of the person on the other end of the call. 

##### How are they built:
The "core" functionality - making audio, video and messaging, so the shared business logic - are written in C++ and built targeting the specific platform. The Windows Skype desktop client is written mostly in Delphi, using the mentioned C++ component for the core business logic. The mobile versions are written in the native language those platforms support, so the iOS client is written in Objective C, Android in Java, Windows Phone in C#. The mobile versions use similar, but mobile optimized C++ libraries to the desktop for the core calling functions.  The other platforms - Mac, XBox, Sony Smart TV etc - all use the native development language for the given platform and similar C++ libraries.

Skype Translator uses machine learning. So the more you use it, the better it gets. Their voice translator currently works in 8 languages, and our text translator is available in more than 50 languages for instant messaging.

#### Google Hangouts
##### How do they function:
Google Hangouts is a communication platform developed by Google which includes messaging, video chat, SMS and VOIP features. Hangouts allows conversations between two or more users. The service can be accessed online through the Gmail or Google+ websites, or through mobile apps available for Android and iOS. Chat histories are saved online, allowing them to be synced between devices. As with the previous Google+ Hangouts, users can also perform a group video chat with up to 10 users at a time.

# 13 Base Project Requirements
### 1. JavaSript - NodeJS/Angular/React
### 2. Operating System: Ubuntu Linux Distribution
### 3. MongoDB used to store data.
### 4. Data encrypted at rest
Passwords are hashed to protect personal information. Private networks are only being used by admin.
### 5. Database Master/Slave Replication
### 6. Use of Responsive Design 
Make sure login and signup are resizable and work cross platforms both on the website and mobile phones. 
### 7. Use of https
Make sure the communication is secured and protected. Real Time Communication. 
#### a. Self-signed certs 
#### b. Google Authentication for login
Using Gmail to login. 
#### c. SQRL
### 8. Use of user authentication
Unathenticated users can use the platform without logging in, by just creating a room and inviting other users in. Transcripts are not stored in their account but end of each call, there will be a summary page with the option to download or email the transcript to themselves. 

Authenticated users will have their own account where they can store their transcripts and have a list of contacts. The list of contacts allows the user to chat or call them when they are online. 

### 9. Creation of Dev Environment (local laptop)
Most of our configurations are done by scripts under provisioners in our VagrantFile.  

### 10. Layout Design
Layout design is simple and user friendly. Not cluttered, it will be minimal but still with all the required functionalityies. 

### 11. Management of Visio
Created diagrams of User workflow and Application architecture
Application Architecture of MEAN stack and MVC infrastructure. 

### 12. Management of Project progress
1. Trello
These cards help us stay on top of our tasks and see what everyone is doing. The cards hold us accountable and responsible for different tasks. If someone runs into a problem, they can ask for help or assistance on slack or in weekly meetings. 

2. Slack
Slack is used extensively to communicate and chat about our progress and problems. Share technologies that could be implemented in our project and see what is feasible. 

3. Github
This is where our entire code is hosted on. We can see who 

4. Github Issues to resolve bug posts from UI/UX tester

### 13. 15 real "test" users and proper data to test functionality of a system - No system is ever used "blank" always fill it up with real data
Users accounts are stored in the database server after the user inputs their personal information in the registration form. There are 15 test users that can login to the authenticated site which allows them use the main functionalities and store transcripts after phone call.
